If an export is re-exported, but its defining module has no codegen output,
that export is invalid for GAS emission.

this is one of the errors that occcurred around this point in commit history >

        freeze failing test before the fix

need to really understand this.

Rule
Every exported symbol must correspond to an identifier defined in emitted JS code.

        this test when run -- shows we have output src to emit .. but cud not find file in dist






dont forget the missing test: 
    we need to explicitly support this type of entry:
            // src/gas/index.ts
            export { onOpen } from "./triggers/onOpen";
            export { doFoo } from "./api/foo";
            export { doBar } from "./api/bar";
