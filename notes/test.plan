The plugin uses user-supplied namespace configuration together with the
resolved, transpiled module sources provided by Webpack’s compilation pipeline
(after dependency resolution and type-checking, but before runtime execution)
to emit clean top-level functions, classes, and namespace exports that are
compatible with both the Apps Script runtime and HtmlService delivery model.



web pack development:

    - set up simple project.. make sure debug w/ devtools works.
        - look at calling code 


    - find out how the plugin can be installed.. then smoke tested that install works.
        - how to ensure not cached and that we have latest version ?


✔ 3. Export Surface Preservation Tests

Ensure the plugin correctly maps:

default exports

named exports

aliased exports

re-exports from COMMON libraries

index-file re-export patterns

Because your plugin needs to attach real symbols to global namespaces, not lose them in translation.

....

Tests that should live in this repo (plugin-level):
Test Type	Purpose
Namespace attachment tests	Ensure globals/namespaces are created correctly
Demodulification tests	Ensure Webpack runtime is fully removed
Export mapping tests	Validate correct exposure of symbol surfaces
UI HTML fragment tests	Ensure UI bundles generate correct HTML
Multi-build tests	GAS/UI/COMMON outputs remain isolated
Integration (Webpack) tests	Ensure real builds behave correctly
Invariant A

All GAS-visible functions exist at top level.

Invariant B

No Webpack runtime appears in the output.

Invariant C

Namespace trees exist before assignments.

Invariant D

COMMON code does not leak into UI or GAS namespaces.

Invariant E

Import → namespace bindings always resolve correctly.
